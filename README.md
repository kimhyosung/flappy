Flappy
======

Flappy (the name stands for **FL**ash-like **AP**i for **PY**thon) is a 
cross-platform graphics/media library with the API very similar to the 
Adobe Flash API. Flappy is built on top of the [SDL2](http://libsdl.org/) 
library and a slightly modified subset of c/c++ code from the 
[OpenFL-Lime](https://github.com/openfl/lime) project.
